# custom-donation
Scripts that allow you to get a custom donation amount from any user. Feel free to use it, it's not written the *best*, however it works and I'm happy to share it.

In ROBLOX, you are not able to donate custom funds using developer products. This is why I wrote this. There are a list of developer products at a range of different prices available, that you have to create yourself. The scripts take the amount of ROBUX the user would like to donate, check if it's within range of a suitable price bracket, check if it's a number, and then prompt them with the smallest amount of developer product prompts as possible until the amount that they have requested to donate is equal to the amount that they have donated.
